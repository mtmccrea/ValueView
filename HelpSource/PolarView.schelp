DESCRIPTION::
A radial plot view for data meant to be visualized in degrees, radians, or other
polar formats (e.g. microphone patterns, cylindrical/spherical harmonics, etc.).
The plot is comprised of multiple layers, each with their own settable
attributes: background, scale grid, data plot, title, and legend.


CLASSMETHODS::

METHOD:: new
Create a new link::Classes/PolarView::.

ARGUMENT:: parent
An optional parent view in which to embed the link::Classes/PolarView::. If
code::nil::, a new window is created for the plot.

ARGUMENT:: bounds
A link::Classes/Rect:: specifying the view's origin within the strong::parent::
view, and its dimensions.

ARGUMENT:: data
An link::Classes/Array:: of data to plot. 2D arrays are considered multichannel
data and plotted separately, each with settable attribute. See the properties
of the link::#-plots:: drawing layer.

ARGUMENT:: thetaArray
An link::Classes/Array:: of values corresponding to angular positions of each
data point, or an array of to be interpreted as envelope breakpoints into which
the data is mapped (typically just a start and end position). 2D arrays are
treated the same as with strong::data::. For more details see link::#-data::.
If code::nil:: thetaArray matches strong::thetaBounds::, mapping the data into
the full sweep range of your plot.

ARGUMENT:: thetaBounds
An link::Classes/Array:: of 2 elements: the lower and upper bound of the sweep
of the plot. These bounds can be describe a plot range equal to or greater than
the  ranges of strong::thetaArray::. The values are relative to the
strong::thetaZeroPosition:: and strong::thetaDirection::.
Default is code::[0, 2pi]::.

ARGUMENT:: rhoBounds
An link::Classes/Array:: of 2 elements: the lower and upper radial bounds of the
plot. If code::nil::, the bounds will be the maximum and minumum value of your
strong::data::. If your data lies outside the range of your strong::rhoBounds::,
it will be clipped on the plot.
Note that if your strong::plotUnits:: are code::\db::, your data will be also
be clipped by link::#-clipDbLow:: in the case this is greater than your lower
bound.

ARGUMENT:: thetaDirection
The sweep direction of the plot, code::\cw:: or code::\ccw::, clockwise or
counter-clockwise, respectively. Default code::\cw::.

ARGUMENT:: thetaZeroPosition
A radian value or position keyword (code::\top::, code::\botom::, code::\left::,
code::\right::) specifying the anglular position of code::0::. When setting this
by a radian value, reference angle code::0:: at the top of the plot (12 o'clock),
advancing in the direction set by the strong::thetaDirection:: argument.

ARGUMENT:: plotRadius
A value normalized to the radius of the view, where code::1.0:: would extend the
plot radius to the edge of the view. Default code::0.9::.
Note::The values of the link::#-thetaGridLines:: displayed in the
link::#-grid:: are drawn just outside the plot's radius, so use a value less
than code::1.0:: to allow room for these labels if you plan to include labels
for the theta grid lines.::

ARGUMENT:: dataUnits
The unit of measurement of your strong::data::: code::\db:: or code::\scalar::.
Default code::\scalar::. This need not match the strong::plotUnits:: argument,
which determines the units the data are displayed in.

ARGUMENT:: plotUnits
The unit of measurement to emphasis::display:: in the plot: code::\db::
or code::\scalar::. Defaults to strong::dataUnits::. The data need not be
provided in the same units as the plotâ€”conversion to the plot's units happens
internally.


INSTANCEMETHODS::

METHOD:: thetaGridLines
Set the range and interval of level lines on the plot. Return the level values
with the getter method of the same name.

ARGUMENT:: spacing
The increment between level lines, in link::#-plotUnits::.

ARGUMENT:: from
The first value to draw a level line, in link::#-plotUnits::. Also accepts
keywords code::\min:: and code::\max::. Default code::\min::.

ARGUMENT:: to
The last value to draw a level line, in link::#-plotUnits::. Also accepts
keywords code::\min:: and code::\max::. Default code::\max::.

ARGUMENT:: refresh
A link::Classes/Boolean::, specifying whether to refresh the view immediately.
Default is code::true::.


METHOD:: thetaGridLinesAt
Draw data level grid lines at specific values, as opposed to even intervals as
in link::#-thetaGridLines::.

ARGUMENT:: thetaArray
An link::Classes/Array:: of values at which to draw level  lines on the plot.
Values should be in the same units as link::#-plotUnits::. Levels that are out
of the range of link::#-rhoMin:: and link::#-rhoMax:: are discarded.

ARGUMENT:: refresh
A link::Classes/Boolean::, specifying whether to refresh the view immediately.
Default is code::true::.


METHOD:: thetaGridLines
Set the spacing between theta (longitude) grid lines.

ARGUMENT:: spacing
The increment between theta lines, in radians.
strong::TODO: make possible degreees::

ARGUMENT:: refresh
A link::Classes/Boolean::, specifying whether to refresh the view immediately.
Default is code::true::.


METHOD:: thetaGridLinesAt
Draw theta (longitude) grid lines at specific values, as opposed to even
intervals as in link::#-thetaGridLines::.

ARGUMENT:: thetaArray
An link::Classes/Array:: of values at which to draw longitude lines on the plot,
in radians. Levels that are out of the range of code::thetaMin:: and
code::thetaMin + thetaRange:: are discarded.

ARGUMENT:: refresh
A link::Classes/Boolean::, specifying whether to refresh the view immediately.
Default is code::true::.


METHOD:: thetaGridLines
Return an link::Classes/Array:: of values which are the levels where lines are
drawn on the plot's grid, in link::#-plotUnits::. Set these levels with
link::#-thetaGridLines::, or link::#-thetaGridLinesAt::.


METHOD:: thetaGridLines
Return an link::Classes/Array:: of values which are the levels where lines are
drawn on the plot's grid, in radians. Set these levels with
link::#-thetaGridLines::, or link::#-thetaGridLinesAt::.


METHOD:: plotData
Get the plot data, stored internally as scalar values, normalized
(unmapped) from the bounds link::#-plotMin:: and
link::#-plotMax::.


METHOD:: scalarData
Return the plot data in scalar values. I.e. if link::#-data:: was set with
code::\db:: values, link::#-scalarData:: returns code::data.dbamp::.


METHOD:: clipDbLow
Set/get the minimum dB level to clip link::#-rhoMin:: when using code::\db:: as
your link::#-plotUnits::. The reason for clipping this value is
code::0.ampdb = -inf::, which breaks link::Classes/ControlSpec::, so this will
catch and clip code::-inf::.  Default code::-90::.


METHOD:: bipolar
Set the plot to display the absolute value of the data (the scalar values),
with negative values shown as a different color. In other words, the sign of the
phase is indicated through color (as set by the code::negativeColors:: attribute
of the link::#-plots:: layer). For example, a figure-of-eight
microphone response pattern would be displayed with a code::rhoSpec:: range of
code::[0, 1]::, but the positive and negative phase lobes would each
be drawn with a different color.

ARGUMENT:: bool
A link::Classes/Boolean:: indicating whether the data should be displayed as
bipolar or not.

ARGUMENT:: refresh
A link::Classes/Boolean::, specifying whether to refresh the view immediately.
Default is code::true::.




METHOD:: rhoSpec
Get/set the link::Classes/ControlSpec:: used to map the (rho) data to the plot.

ARGUMENT:: spec
A link::Classes/ControlSpec::.

ARGUMENT:: recalcNow
A link::Classes/Boolean::, specifying whether to recalculate the internal data
immediately (recommended). In some special cases, e.g. large datasets and
multiple parameter-setting operations, you may want to only rescale the data at
the end of all of the operations. Default is code::true::.

ARGUMENT:: refresh
A link::Classes/Boolean::, specifying whether to refresh the view immediately.
Default is code::true::.


METHOD:: rhoMinMax
Set the min and max levels displayed on the plot, in link::#-plotUnits::.
Data outside this range is clipped. This is the preferred way to set the min and
max at the same time.

ARGUMENT:: min
Minimum value to display, in link::#-plotUnits::.

ARGUMENT:: max
Maximum value to display, in link::#-plotUnits::.

ARGUMENT:: refresh
A link::Classes/Boolean::, specifying whether to refresh the view immediately.
Default is code::true::.


METHOD:: rhoMin
Set the minimum level displayed on the plot.
Data outside this range is clipped. To set both the min and max at the same time,
it's more efficient to use link::#-rhoMinMax::.

ARGUMENT:: min
Minimum value to display, in link::#-plotUnits::.

ARGUMENT:: rescaleNow
A link::Classes/Boolean::, specifying whether to recalculate internal data
immediately. Many of these calculations would be redundant of followed by
setting link::#-rhoMax:: (hence the link::#-rhoMinMax:: method), which is
noticeable with large data sets. Default is code::true::.

ARGUMENT:: refresh
A link::Classes/Boolean::, specifying whether to refresh the view immediately.
Default is code::true::.


METHOD:: rhoMax
Set the maximum level displayed on the plot.
Data outside this range is clipped. To set both the min and max at the same time,
it's more efficient to use link::#-rhoMinMax::.

ARGUMENT:: max
Maximum value to display, in link::#-plotUnits::.

ARGUMENT:: rescaleNow
A link::Classes/Boolean::, specifying whether to recalculate internal data
immediately. Many of these calculations would be redundant of followed by
setting link::#-rhoMin:: (hence the link::#-rhoMinMax:: method), which is
noticeable with large data sets. Default is code::true::.

ARGUMENT:: refresh
A link::Classes/Boolean::, specifying whether to refresh the view immediately.
Default is code::true::.


METHOD:: plotRadius
Get/set the normalized value of the plot radius.

ARGUMENT:: normRadius
A value normalized to the radius of the view (the half-length of its smallest
side), where code::1.0:: would extend the plot radius to the edge of the view.
Default code::0.9::.
Note:: The labels of the link::#-thetaGridLines:: displayed on the edge of the
link::#-grid:: are drawn just outside the plot's radius, so use a value less
than code::1.0:: to allow room for these labels if you plan to include labels
for the theta grid lines.::



METHOD:: thetaDirection
Get/set the positive direction of the plot: clockwise or counterclockwise. This
affects the display of the data, as well as the direction of the offset of the
link::#-thetaMin:: from the link::#-zeroPos::.

ARGUMENT:: dir
A link::Classes/Symbol::, code::\cw:: or code::\ccw::.



METHOD:: thetas
Return an link::Classes/Array:: of the theta positions of the data points. Used
internally and by the drawing layer classes.


METHOD:: plotWarp
* Not yet implemented *

ARGUMENT:: warp
TBD





METHOD:: data
Set the data to plot.

ARGUMENT:: dataArray
An link::Classes/Array:: of values to plot. If the array is 2D, the data is
considered to be multichannel and will plot the values of each sub-array.

ARGUMENT:: thetaArray
An link::Classes/Array:: of values corresponding to angular positions of each
data point. 2D arrays are treated the same as in strong::dataArray::.

If code::thetaArray.size < dataArray.size::, then sub-arrays
code::dataArray[i]:: are associated with code::thetaArray.wrapAt(i)::.

If the size of each sub-array in strong::thetaArray:: doesn't match the size of
its associated sub-array in strong::dataArray::, the elements are considered
breakpoints of an link::Classes/Env::, and the data points are mapped into that
envelope. For example a strong::dataArray:: of size 100 paired with a
strong::thetaArray:: of code::[0, 2pi]:: would uniformly distribute all 100 values
of strong::dataArray:: into the range of code::0:: to code::2pi::.

If code::nil::, dataArray is mapped evenly into the range
code::[thetaMin, thetaMax]::.

ARGUMENT:: units
A link::Classes/Symbol:: indicating the units of the data in strong::dataArray:::
code::\db:: or code::\scalar::. This is independent of link::#-plotUnits::.
Default code::\scalar::.

ARGUMENT:: bipolar
A link::Classes/Boolean::, specifying whether the data should be considered
bipolar, where data is plotted as values, and color indicates polarity/phase.
See link::#-bipolar::. Default is code::false::.

ARGUMENT:: refresh
A link::Classes/Boolean::, specifying whether to refresh the view immediately.
Default is code::true::.



METHOD:: background
Get/set the background color of the view.

ARGUMENT:: color
A link::Classes/Color::.



METHOD:: thetaMin
Set/get the angular position of the plot's lower bound.

ARGUMENT:: radians
A radian angle, relative to link::#-zeroPos:: and link::#-thetaDirection::.

ARGUMENT:: refresh
A link::Classes/Boolean::, specifying whether to refresh the view immediately.
Default is code::true::.



METHOD:: zeroPos
Set/get the reference for the angular direction of zero. This angle will be relative
to the code::\top:: (12 o'clock) position, and the link::#-thetaDirection:: you specify
(clockwise or counterclockwise). The link::#-thetaMin:: references this position.

strong::TODO: does zero refer to the value zero or the start of the data spec?,
i.e. what happens if the data doens't include a domain value of 0? could rename
so something like "referenceHeading"::

ARGUMENT:: radiansOrDir
A radian angle, referencing code::0:: as up, and a positive offset from code::0::
degrees in either a clockwise or counterclockwise direction as specified by
link::#-thetaDirection::.
Also accepts keywords: code::\top::, code::\botom::, code::\left::, code::\right::.

ARGUMENT:: refresh
A link::Classes/Boolean::, specifying whether to refresh the view immediately.
Default is code::true::.



METHOD:: plotUnits
Get or set the units used to display the data: code::\db:: or code::\scalar::.
strong::Note::: The data you set need not match the plot's units, your data
units are set through the link::#-data:: method, and is converted to the plot's
units for display.

ARGUMENT:: dbOrScalar
A link::Classes/Symbol::: code::\db:: or code::\scalar::.

ARGUMENT:: min
The minimum value at which to clip the plot levels, in link::#-plotUnits::.

ARGUMENT:: max
The maximum value at which to clip the plot levels, in link::#-plotUnits::.


METHOD:: cen
Return a link::Classes/Point:: thar is the center of the plot, in pixels.

SUBSECTION:: Drawing layers
The plot is comprised of multiple layers, each with their own settable
attributes: background, scale grid, data plots, title, and legend. Each drawing
layer has a code::*properties:: list (an link::Classes/Event::), the keys of
which can be accessed as pseudo-methods for getting and setting their values.
Setting an attribute automatically refreshes the view. For example:
code::
// assuming you've created a PolarView 'myPolarPlot'
myPolarPlot.title.show = false;    // hide the title box layer
myPolarPlot.grid.strokeWidth = 2;  // set the stroke width of the grid layer to 2 pixels
::

METHOD:: background
Return the drawing layer class link::Classes/PolarBackgroundLayer::, which has
the following attributes:

METHOD:: grid
Return the drawing layer class link::Classes/PolarGridLayer::, which has
the following attributes:

METHOD:: plots
Return the drawing layer class link::Classes/PolarPlotLayer::, which has
the following attributes:

METHOD:: title
Return the drawing layer class link::Classes/PolarTitleLayer::, which has
the following attributes:

METHOD:: legend
